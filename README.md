# CryptoLabs
JAVA 9
Laboratory work, was done as part of the data protection course 09.03.01

Lab1 includes the next algorithms
  - Baby-step giant-step 
  - ModPow
  - Diffie-Hellman кеу
  - Extended Euclidean algorithm
  
Lab2 includes the next algorithms
 - RSA
 - Elgama
 - Vernam
 - Shamir
 
  All the algorithms can encrypt and decrypt files with the exception of the Vernam's algorithm(encoding problem) 

Lab3 includes the next DS algorithms
  - GOST R-34.10-94
  - RSA
  - Elgama
  
  All signatures can be saved in files.
